   - Announce the launch of the website on social media and relevant platforms.
   - Collect feedback and make iterative improvements based on user input.
   - Regularly update the site with new projects and content.

## My Path So Far

My journey into technology began with a curiosity for coding, which has evolved into a passion for web development, design, and AI. From creating my first text-based game to developing dynamic web applications, I've always sought to learn and grow. This portfolio website is the culmination of years of hard work, learning, and dedication.
