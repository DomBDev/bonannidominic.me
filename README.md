Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website! This project showcases my skills and experience as a Full Stack Web Developer, using modern web technologies like React.js, Express.js, Node.js, and Tailwind CSS.

## My Path So Far

My journey into technology began with a curiosity for coding, which has evolved into a passion for web development, design, and AI.
